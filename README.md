Aim:
To begin learning Python programming through a beginner friendly introduction to fundamental concepts such as data types, variables, and operators.

This notebook provides a structured introduction to the basics of Python programming. It focuses on core concepts including variables, data types (such as integers, floats, and strings), arithmetic operators, user input handling, mathematical calculations, and decision-making statements. These foundational elements are essential for building a strong base in programming and preparing for more advanced topics.

Throughout the exercises, we learned how to declare variables and assign values to them appropriately. We practiced taking user input and converting it into suitable data types for performing computations. The program also demonstrated the use of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve basic numerical problems.

In addition, we explored comparison operators such as greater than (>) and greater than or equal to (>=) within conditional statements. These operators were used to implement decisionmaking logic, allowing the program to execute different outputs based on specific conditions. This helped in understanding how logical reasoning is applied in programming.

Overall, this notebook strengthened our understanding of fundamental Python concepts and improved our confidence in writing simple, structured programs. It serves as a solid foundation for progressing toward more complex programming tasks.
